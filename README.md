## Requirements
The used target framework of Zammad Client Library for .NET is .NET Standard 2.0.
Therefore, your application's target framework must have at least .NET Framework 4.6.1, .NET Core 2.0, or .NET Standard 2.0.

[.NET Standard implementation support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support)

## Download & Install
The Client Library ships on NuGet. You'll find the latest version and hotfixes on NuGet via the `Zammad.Client` package.

### Via Git
To get the source code of the Library via git just type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asesjix/Zammad-Client.git
cd Zammad-Client
```

### Via NuGet
To get the binaries of this library ready for use within your project you can also have them installed by [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Zammad.Client).

Package Manager
```bash
Install-Package Zammad.Client
```

.NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package Zammad.Client
```

## Dependencies

### Newtonsoft Json
The library depend on Newtonsoft Json, which can be downloaded directly or referenced by your code project through Nuget.

- [Newtonsoft.Json](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json)

## Code Samples

First, include the classes you need (in this case we'll include the Client and Ticket feature to demonstrate get all tickets):

```csharp
using Zammad.Client;
using Zammad.Client.Resources;
```
To perform an operation you will first instantiate a *client* which allows performing actions on it.

```csharp
var account = ZammadAccount.CreateBasicAccount("https://contoso.zammad.com", "user", "password");
var ticketClient = account.CreateTicketClient();
```

Now, to get all tickets using the client:

```csharp
var ticketList = ticketClient.GetTicketListAsync();
```

Now, to create a ticket using the client:

```csharp
var ticket = await ticketClient.CreateTicketAsync(
	new Ticket
	{
		Title = "Help me!",
		GroupId = 1,
		CustomerId = 1,
		OwnerId = 1,
	},
	new TicketArticle
	{
		Subject = "Help me!!!",
		Body = "Nothing Work!",
		Type = "note",
	});
```

## Testing

To run the integration tests, a Zammad instance is required.

You can start a local Zammad instance using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Initial Setup

If you haven't done so already, you need to perform some initial setup:

1. Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.
2. Start the setup wizard
3. Create the admin account
    - Email: `admin@example.org`
    - Password: `TestPassword1234`
4. Complete the setup wizard

### Run Tests

```bash
dotnet test
```
